# Credit_Predictor
An end-to-end credit score prediction system built with Django. The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model (serialized via joblib) and scales input data using a stored scaler. Users receive instant predictions and can download a professionally formatted PDF report summarizing their input and credit score.
